Each calendar plot is made up of the following components:
- X axis (Day of week)
- Y axis (Time of the day)
- Grid Lines
- Events (Rectangles)

The X axis and Y axis have default values but can be customized 


```python
from latent_calendar.plot import plot_blank_calendar
from latent_calendar.plot.elements import DayLabeler, TimeLabeler, PlotAxes




```
