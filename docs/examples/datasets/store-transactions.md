By default, a new `cal` attribute will be added to DataFrames given access to module functionality.

```python
df_wide = df.cal.aggregate_events("Country", "InvoiceDate")

df_wide.head()
```

We can clearly see the weekly hours of operation for these countries. Even though these are online transactions, these hours affect the transaction times.

The slight shift in hours for the UK might be the difference in time zones between the UK and the other countries. Maybe it could be difference in buying patterns of these populations. Not sure but this visual gives us a good glance at the data and starting point to ask questions

```python
countries = ["United Kingdom", "Germany", "France"]

(
    df_wide
    .loc[countries]
    .cal.normalize("max")
    .cal.plot_by_row()
)
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.suptitle("Store Transactions by Country")
plt.show()
```
